## Imposter Syndrome

Imposter Syndrome is a feeling of _being a fraud_ or _not being good enough_ to get the job done. Common among software engineers, developers, and designers working in tech companies. 

If you suffer from imposter syndrome you may have a sense of inadequacy or insecurity about your ability to contribute. In reality, you may be perfectly capable and do contribute to your tasks.

These thoughts are fairly common if you struggle with imposter syndrome:

* "What am I doing here?"
* "I am not a developer. I am fooling myself and other people." (feels fake)
* "My colleagues are much smarter than me; I could never match up to them." (undermines own achievements)
* "My coworkers have told me I've achieved a lot, but I feel like it's never enough." (discounts praise)
* "I have no idea how I got through the interview process." (feels only luck dictates results)
* "I will be ridiculed and fired when people realize I am not as smart as I portrayed myself as being." (fears failure)
* "My IQ is not high enough to work here." (doubts inherent ability)
